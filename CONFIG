Uploaded images:
- files are stored in <some-base-dir>/user_images/<userid>/profile|images/filename.ext
- <some-base-dir> is defined in php files (uploadImage, register)
- <some-base-dir> is also defined in bike_global.js. 
- Both these need to align for things to work!
- user_images dir is checked into git but permissions may need to be set on it (a+w).

e.g.
- could be that php stores in /var/www/xx/user_images/....
- JS could access this via http://someserver/ which has its doc root set to /var/www/xx

Hopefully I'll remember what this means when I read it again!
